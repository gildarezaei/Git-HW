# Pull Request (PR)

## Explanation
A Pull Request is a GitHub feature that allows you to propose changes to a repository. When you create a PR, you're asking the repository maintainers to "pull" your changes into their codebase. It's a way to review, discuss, and merge code changes collaboratively. PRs are commonly used in open source projects and team development workflows.

## Key Points
- Proposes merging your branch into another branch (usually main/master)
- Allows code review before merging
- Enables discussion about proposed changes
- Can include automated tests and checks
- Maintainers can request changes before approval
- Creates a merge commit when accepted

## Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Make your changes and commit them
3. Push your branch to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Team reviews and discusses changes
6. Make requested changes if needed
7. PR gets approved and merged

## Benefits
- Code review and quality assurance
- Documentation of changes
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Prevention of breaking changes
- Automated testing integration

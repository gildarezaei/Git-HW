# Clone

## Explanation
Cloning creates a local copy of a Git repository on your computer. This copies all the files, commit history, and branches from the remote repository to your local machine. Unlike forking (which happens on GitHub), cloning happens locally and gives you a working directory where you can make changes.

## Key Points
- Downloads the entire repository to your local computer
- Creates a local Git repository with full history
- Allows you to work offline after cloning
- You can push changes back to the remote repository (if you have permission)
- Multiple people can clone the same repository

## Use Cases
- Setting up a local development environment
- Contributing to a project you have access to
- Working on a project offline
- Creating backups of repositories

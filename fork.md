# Fork

## Explanation
A fork is a complete copy of someone else's repository that you create in your own GitHub account. Unlike cloning, which creates a local copy on your computer, forking creates a server-side copy on GitHub that becomes your own repository. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Key Points
- Creates an independent copy of the repository under your GitHub account
- You become the owner of the forked repository
- Original repository owner is not notified when you fork
- Useful for contributing to open source projects
- You can sync your fork with the original repository to get updates

## Use Cases
- Contributing to open source projects
- Creating your own version of a project
- Experimenting with changes without affecting the original
- Learning from existing codebases
